# Cuora
Cuora is a web-based prototype that aims to provide plugin tools that complement the existing SCSE website. It was created with the main goal to automate answering of questions pertaining to the School Of Computer Science and Engineering in Nanyang Technological University. Questions from incoming students and current students can be queried through the chatbot. Answers to the questions are supplied by SCSE Ambassadors' own experiences and way of answering to provide a humanized yet accurate source of information. Additional functions like a GPA calculator have been added.

## Code
The frontend site is built using Bootstrap 4.0 - Modified Templates as well as Embed which provides real time retrieval of SCSE's Social Media Accounts i.e. Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. The backend server is built upon Flask working alongside Amazon Web Services APIs. Using Amazon Lex's capabilities which provides conversational interfaces for the prototype, we were able to built a simple Chatbot that could answer FAQs and Course related information in SCSE.
