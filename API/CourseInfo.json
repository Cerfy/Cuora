                        "CourseAims": "Cyber‐physical systems (CPSs) leverage computing and communication resources to control physical processes. Cars, aircraft, and robots are prime examples, because they move physically in space in a way that is determined by discrete computerized control algorithms. Designing these algorithms to control CPSs is challenging due to their tight coupling with physical behaviour. At the same time, it is vital that these algorithms be correct, since we rely on CPSs for safety critical tasks like keeping aircraft from colliding The primary aim of this course is to cover two key aspects in CPS design, namely dynamic systems modelling and designing embedded systems to control CPSs. The course uses state‐of‐the‐art modelling techniques exposes student to practical systems that applies CPS design.",

This course aids you to acquire necessary skills for analysing and estimating the performance of computing systems, and to design high‐performance computing systems. In this course, there is a strong emphasis on the study of techniques for improving the power efficiency of single and multiple processor systems. Students will complete this course with a useful appreciation and understanding of processor design issues relating to simplicity of implementation, performance‐enhancement techniques, and power‐reduction methods.",
